cb_preprocess.R
	citibikeOct13: 1037712 observations
	citibikeOct13pp
		we consider only trips less than 30 minutes
	 	(looking at histogram of trip duration we see that most of the trips last from 5 to 8 minutes, 
		the number of trips that last more than 30 minutes is 5.7%)
		tripdistance at least 200m (there are a number of trips less than 50 m - mistake)
		tripduration > 60s
		959351 observations
		change start and stop time into POSIXlt

	for each station with more than 100 observation perform cutting, and keep this data for a model of tripduration
	cutting based on median (0.8m,1.2m) of trip duration for a station
	
cb_duration_hist.R
	histogram of tripduration
	
cb_speed.R cb_speed_between_stations
