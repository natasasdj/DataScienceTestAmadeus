taxi data
citibike data

model for trip duration: both in taxi and citibike 
compare two models

taxi: model for trip duration
- predictors: pickup location (latitude and longitude), dropoff location (latitude and longitude), pickup time
	- location and distance - continous variables 
	- how to use pickup time as a predictors: constract hour predictor: hour+min/60
	- what if traveled distance much larger than distance: make linear model for traveled distance vs distance, than if not within 10% discard it

- models: 
svm - only possible to run if divide into hour chunks
random tree - ok to run on the whole day
